# Numerical Simulations of the Evolution of the *Uta stansburiana* lizard

## Equilibrium solutions while changing behavior from rock-paper-scissors game.

`BifurcationRPS.m`

You may have to manually change some variables to produce all the graphs.

## Equilibrium solutions while changing behavior from our standard lizard matrix.

`Bifurcation.m`

Again, you can produce all the graphs by changing variables and saving.

## Abrupt changes in environmental conditions

`catastrophegraph.m` and `catastrophe.m` which produce the pictures.
